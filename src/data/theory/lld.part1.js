        topic: 'Applying OOP to Design (Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism)',
        summary: 'The four OOP pillars are the vocabulary you use to turn requirements into a clean class model.',
        explanation:
          'Low-level design is the act of translating a fuzzy requirement ("build a parking lot system") into a precise set of classes, their data, their behaviour, and how they collaborate. Object-oriented programming gives you the four building blocks for that translation: abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. In an LLD interview you are not graded on knowing the definitions but on using them to produce a model that is easy to extend and hard to break.\n\nAbstraction means exposing only what a caller needs and hiding the rest. A PaymentGateway exposes pay(amount) and refund(txnId); the caller never sees the HTTP retries or the encryption inside. Good abstraction is about picking the right interface — the smallest, most stable set of operations a client depends on. Encapsulation is the mechanism that protects an abstraction: you make fields private and expose behaviour through methods so that invariants (e.g. balance can never go negative) are enforced in one place rather than scattered across callers.\n\nInheritance models an IS-A relationship and lets a subclass reuse and specialise a base type. It is powerful but dangerous: it creates the tightest coupling in OOP because the subclass depends on the parent internals. Polymorphism is the payoff of good abstraction and inheritance — a caller holds a reference of the base/interface type and the correct overridden method runs at runtime (dynamic dispatch). This is what lets you add a new Shape or a new NotificationChannel without touching the code that uses them.\n\nIn practice an LLD answer is mostly abstraction plus encapsulation, with polymorphism used at the seams where behaviour varies, and inheritance used sparingly. A common rookie mistake is to reach for deep inheritance trees; senior candidates reach for small interfaces and composition. Keep the pillars in mind as a checklist: Is each class hiding its data? Does each class expose a clean, minimal interface? Where does behaviour vary, and have I made that a polymorphic seam?',

This decouples callers from concrete classes.' },

        topic: 'HAS-A Relationships: Association vs Aggregation vs Composition vs Dependency',
        summary: 'Four flavours of "one object uses/owns another", ranked by how strong the ownership is.',
        explanation:
          'When one class holds or uses another, that is a HAS-A relationship, and interviewers love to test whether you can distinguish its four strengths. From weakest to strongest they are: dependency, association, aggregation, and composition. The distinction is about lifetime ownership and how tightly the objects are bound, and UML draws each with a different arrow.\n\nA dependency is the weakest: class A uses class B transiently, usually as a method parameter, local variable, or return type, but does not keep a reference. Example: Order.calculateTax(TaxCalculator calc) — Order depends on TaxCalculator only for the duration of the call. UML draws it as a dashed arrow. An association is stronger: A keeps a long-lived reference to B as a field, but neither owns the other and they have independent lifetimes. Example: a Teacher object has a reference to Student objects and vice versa. UML draws a solid line (with optional direction arrow and multiplicity).\n\nAggregation is a "whole-part" association where the whole holds parts but does not own their lifecycle — the parts can exist independently and can be shared. Example: a Department aggregates Professors; deleting the Department does not delete the Professors, and a Professor could belong to another Department. UML draws a hollow diamond ◇ on the whole side. Composition is the strongest whole-part: the part cannot exist without the whole and is exclusively owned, so when the whole is destroyed its parts are destroyed too. Example: a House composes Rooms — destroy the House and the Rooms cease to exist; a Room belongs to exactly one House. UML draws a filled diamond ◆ on the whole side.\n\nThe practical test in an interview: ask "if the container is destroyed, should the contained object also be destroyed, and can the contained object be shared?" If destroyed together and not shared, it is composition. If it survives independently or is shared, it is aggregation. If there is only a transient use with no stored reference, it is dependency. Choosing correctly affects constructor design (composition usually creates its parts internally) and cascade-delete logic in real systems.',

          { q: 'How does composition usually show up in constructor design?', a: 'In composition the whole typically creates and owns its parts internally (e.g. House builds its Rooms in its constructor), so the part reference is never passed in or shared. In aggregation the part is usually passed into the constructor or a setter because it is created elsewhere and may be shared.' },
          { q: 'Why does the relationship type matter beyond UML diagrams?', a: 'It drives real behaviour: cascade deletes (composition cascades, aggregation does not), serialization boundaries, ownership of cleanup, and coupling.

        id: 'lld-inheritance-vs-composition',
        topic: 'IS-A vs HAS-A: Inheritance vs Composition & Multiplicity',
        summary: 'Inheritance models IS-A; composition models HAS-A. Multiplicity quantifies how many.',
        explanation:
          'Two relationships dominate class diagrams: IS-A (inheritance) and HAS-A (composition/aggregation). Inheritance expresses that a subtype is a specialised kind of a supertype — a SavingsAccount IS-A Account, a Car IS-A Vehicle. The subtype inherits the supertype\'s contract and can be substituted wherever the supertype is expected (this is what the Liskov Substitution Principle protects). UML draws inheritance with a hollow triangle ▷ pointing at the parent, and interface realisation with a dashed line and hollow triangle.\n\nComposition expresses that an object is built out of other objects — a Car HAS-A Engine, an Order HAS-A list of LineItems. The classic LLD guidance is "favour composition over inheritance" because composition is more flexible: you can swap the contained object at runtime, you only depend on its public interface, and you avoid the fragile-base-class problem where a parent change breaks all subclasses. Inheritance is a compile-time, all-or-nothing reuse mechanism; composition is a runtime, pick-what-you-need mechanism.\n\nA reliable heuristic: use inheritance only when the IS-A relationship is genuine, stable, and you truly want substitutability and polymorphism through the base type. If you are inheriting just to reuse a few methods, that is a code smell — use composition (delegate to a contained object) instead. A famous example: a Stack should NOT extend ArrayList (a Stack is not a list — you would inherit push/pop and also expose get(index) and add(index), violating the Stack abstraction); instead a Stack should HAS-A list and delegate.\n\nMultiplicity (cardinality) annotates the ends of an association to say how many instances participate: 1 (exactly one), 0..1 (optional), * or 0..* (zero or more), 1..* (one or more), or a fixed n. Example: an Order 1 ──► 1..* LineItem means one order has at least one line item, and a Customer 1 ──► 0..* Order means a customer may have any number of orders including none. Getting multiplicity right communicates business rules directly on the diagram and tells the reader whether to use a single reference or a collection field.',

        id: 'lld-coupling-cohesion',
        topic: 'Coupling & Cohesion',
        summary: 'Aim for low coupling (few, weak dependencies) and high cohesion (each class does one thing).',
        explanation:
          'Coupling and cohesion are the two quality metrics that underlie almost every design principle. Coupling measures how dependent modules are on each other; cohesion measures how focused and related the responsibilities inside a single module are. The golden rule of design is "low coupling, high cohesion" — and nearly every SOLID/GRASP principle is just a specific tactic to achieve it.\n\nLow coupling means a class depends on as few other classes as possible, and those dependencies are on stable abstractions (interfaces) rather than concrete implementations. Tightly coupled code is brittle: a change in one class ripples into many others, it is hard to test in isolation (you must construct a web of collaborators), and it is hard to reuse. You reduce coupling by depending on interfaces (DIP), passing dependencies in rather than constructing them internally (dependency injection), and limiting how much one object reaches into another (Law of Demeter).\n\nHigh cohesion means everything in a class belongs together and serves a single, well-defined purpose. A cohesive UserAuthenticator only authenticates; a low-cohesion "GodClass" or "UtilityManager" does authentication, logging, emailing, and report generation, which makes it large, hard to name, and a magnet for change. High cohesion is essentially the Single Responsibility Principle viewed from the class\'s perspective: one reason to change. Cohesive classes are easier to name (the name describes exactly one job), easier to test, and easier to reuse.\n\nThe two are related: pushing for high cohesion tends to lower coupling, because focused classes have fewer reasons to reach into others. Interviewers probe this with questions like "your class is doing too much — how would you split it?" or "this change touched ten files, what does that tell you about the design?" (answer: high coupling). When you justify a design decision, framing it as "this lowers coupling" or "this raises cohesion" signals senior-level reasoning.',

        explanation:
          'The class diagram is the single most important UML diagram for low-level design — it is what you draw on the whiteboard to communicate your model. A class is a rectangle with three compartments: the class name on top, attributes (fields) in the middle, and operations (methods) at the bottom. You can omit compartments to reduce clutter, but the name is mandatory.\n\nEach member has a visibility marker: + for public, - for private, # for protected, and ~ for package/default. Attributes are written as visibility name : Type (e.g. - balance : double) and methods as visibility name(params) : ReturnType (e.g. + withdraw(amount : double) : boolean). Static members are underlined, and abstract members are shown in italics. An abstract class has its name in italics (or a {abstract} tag); an interface is marked with the «interface» stereotype above its name and typically lists only operations.\n\nRelationships are the lines connecting classes, and each has a precise arrowhead. Inheritance (generalisation) uses a solid line with a hollow triangle ▷ pointing at the parent. Interface realisation uses a dashed line with a hollow triangle ▷. Association is a solid line (optionally directed with an open arrow ►). Aggregation is a solid line with a hollow diamond ◇ at the owner end. Composition is a solid line with a filled diamond ◆ at the owner end. Dependency is a dashed line with an open arrow ► (used for transient use like method parameters).\n\nMultiplicities sit at the line ends (1, 0..1, *, 1..*) and role names can label what each end represents. Reading a class diagram fluently — and drawing one quickly and correctly — is a baseline expectation in LLD rounds; interviewers often ask you to sketch the class diagram before you write any code, and a clean diagram with correct arrows is itself a strong signal. Practise drawing the six relationship arrows from memory.',

        summary: 'Sequence diagrams show how objects collaborate over time to fulfil one scenario.',
        explanation:
          'Where a class diagram shows the static structure, a sequence diagram shows dynamic behaviour — the time-ordered exchange of messages between objects to accomplish one specific scenario (e.g. "user places an order"). It is the second most useful UML diagram in LLD and is excellent for explaining a flow during an interview.\n\nThe key elements: each participating object is drawn at the top as a box (Actor : Class) with a vertical dashed line dropping down called its lifeline, representing the object\'s existence over time. Time flows downward. A message is a horizontal arrow from the caller\'s lifeline to the callee\'s. A synchronous (blocking) call uses a solid line with a filled arrowhead ►; the caller waits for it to return. A return is drawn as a dashed line with an open arrowhead ◄. An asynchronous message (fire-and-forget) uses a solid line with an open arrowhead.\n\nWhen an object is actively processing a message, a thin vertical rectangle called an activation bar (or focus of control) is drawn on its lifeline. Nested activation bars show a method calling another method that is still in progress. Object creation is shown by a message arrow pointing to a participant box drawn lower down (not at the top), and object destruction is marked with a large X at the bottom of its lifeline.\n\nSequence diagrams also support combined fragments for control flow: alt for if/else alternatives, opt for an optional block, loop for repetition, and par for parallel execution, each drawn as a labelled box around the relevant messages. In an interview, sketching a sequence diagram for the main happy path (and maybe one error path) demonstrates that you understand the runtime collaboration and not just the static classes — it is a great way to walk the interviewer through your design.',

        topic: 'Use-Case & Activity Diagrams (Brief)',
        summary: 'Use-case diagrams capture WHO does WHAT; activity diagrams capture the workflow/flowchart.',
        explanation:
          'Beyond class and sequence diagrams, two more UML diagrams come up in LLD discussions, usually briefly. A use-case diagram captures functional requirements from the user\'s point of view: which actors interact with the system and what goals (use cases) they can achieve. Actors are stick figures (a human role like Customer, or an external system); use cases are ovals labelled with a verb phrase like "Place Order"; the system boundary is a box around the use cases. Lines connect actors to the use cases they participate in.\n\nUse-case relationships add nuance: «include» means one use case always uses another (e.g. "Place Order" includes "Validate Cart"), drawn as a dashed arrow labelled «include». «extend» means a use case optionally adds behaviour to another under a condition (e.g. "Apply Coupon" extends "Place Order"), drawn as a dashed arrow labelled «extend». Generalisation between actors (e.g. PremiumCustomer is a Customer) uses a hollow triangle. Use-case diagrams are a requirements-gathering tool — in an interview they map cleanly onto the "identify actors and their actions" step.\n\nAn activity diagram is essentially a UML flowchart that models the flow of control through a process or algorithm. It uses a filled circle for the start node, rounded rectangles for activities/actions, diamonds for decisions (with guard conditions like [valid] / [invalid] on the outgoing edges), arrows for transitions, and a filled circle inside a ring for the end node. A horizontal or vertical bar represents a fork (split into parallel flows) and a join (synchronise parallel flows back together).\n\nActivity diagrams can also use swimlanes (partitions) to show which actor or component is responsible for each activity — useful for modelling a multi-party workflow like an order-fulfilment pipeline. In LLD interviews these two diagrams are secondary to class and sequence diagrams, but knowing them lets you pick the right tool: use cases to nail down scope, activity diagrams to reason about a complex algorithm or workflow with branches and parallelism.',

        topic: 'Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)',
        summary: 'A class should have only one reason to change — one responsibility, one actor.',
        explanation:
          'The Single Responsibility Principle states that a class should have only one reason to change. Robert C. Martin sharpens "reason to change" to mean "one actor" — a single source of requirements/stakeholders that drives changes to that class. If two different stakeholders (say the accounting team and the reporting team) can both force you to edit the same class, it has two responsibilities and violates SRP.\n\nThe smell SRP prevents is the GodClass / "Swiss-army-knife" class that mixes unrelated concerns. Consider a bad design: an Employee class with calculatePay(), saveToDatabase(), and generateReport(). These belong to three different actors — finance owns pay rules, the DBA owns persistence, and reporting owns formatting. A change requested by any one of them risks breaking the others, merge conflicts pile up, and the class becomes hard to test because you must drag in a database and a report engine just to test pay logic.\n\nThe refactored good design splits responsibilities into focused collaborators: an Employee holds data and pay-policy logic, an EmployeeRepository handles persistence, and an EmployeeReportFormatter handles report generation. Now each class has one actor and one reason to change; you can test pay logic with no database, swap the persistence layer without touching pay rules, and change the report format independently. This is high cohesion in action.\n\nA practical caution: SRP is about reasons to change, not about making every class tiny or having exactly one method. Over-applying it produces an explosion of anaemic one-method classes that are themselves hard to follow. The skill is identifying genuine responsibility boundaries — usually along stakeholder/actor lines. In interviews, when a class name contains "and" or a vague word like Manager/Processor/Util, that is your cue to ask whether it is violating SRP.',

        summary: 'Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.',
        explanation:
          'The Open/Closed Principle states that software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification — you should be able to add new behaviour by adding new code, not by editing existing, tested code. The motivation is risk: every time you modify working code you risk introducing regressions, so a design that lets you extend via new classes is safer and more maintainable.\n\nThe smell OCP prevents is the ever-growing if-else / switch on a type. Consider a bad design: an AreaCalculator with computeArea(Shape s) that does if (s is Circle) ... else if (s is Rectangle) ... else if (s is Triangle).... Every time a new shape is added you must crack open and re-test this method, and the same switch tends to get copy-pasted (perimeter, draw, etc.), so one new shape touches many places. This is closed for extension and open for modification — exactly backwards.\n\nThe refactored good design uses polymorphism. Define an abstract Shape with an abstract area() method, and let each concrete shape (Circle, Rectangle, Triangle) implement its own area(). The AreaCalculator now just calls shape.area() with no type checks. Adding a Hexagon means writing one new class that extends Shape — the calculator and all existing shapes are untouched and need no re-testing. The system is open for extension (new shape classes) and closed for modification (existing code unchanged).\n\nThe enabling mechanisms for OCP are abstraction and polymorphism: program against an interface/abstract base, and inject the concrete behaviour. The Strategy, Template Method, and Decorator patterns are concrete realisations of OCP. A caveat: you cannot make everything open to every kind of change — you anticipate the likely axis of variation (here, "new shapes") and design the abstraction around it. Guessing wrong leads to needless abstraction (YAGNI). Interviewers often probe OCP by asking "now add a new type — how much existing code do you change?" The ideal answer is "none, I add a class."',

        summary: 'Subtypes must be substitutable for their base type without breaking correctness.',
        explanation:
          'The Liskov Substitution Principle states that objects of a subclass must be usable anywhere objects of the superclass are expected, without altering the correctness of the program. In other words, a subtype must honour the behavioural contract of its base type — same (or weaker) preconditions, same (or stronger) postconditions, preserved invariants, and no surprising exceptions. LSP is what makes polymorphism safe; if a subclass can break callers that hold a base reference, your inheritance is lying.\n\nThe classic violation is the Rectangle/Square problem. Geometrically a square is a rectangle, so one models class Square extends Rectangle. But Rectangle has independent setWidth() and setHeight(); Square must keep width == height, so its setWidth() also changes height. Now any code written against Rectangle — e.g. "set width to 5, set height to 4, assert area == 20" — breaks when handed a Square (it gets 16). The Square cannot be substituted for a Rectangle, so the inheritance violates LSP even though "a square IS-A rectangle" sounds true.\n\nAnother common violation is throwing or no-op-ing an inherited method. If Bird has fly() and you make Penguin extends Bird, Penguin.fly() must either misbehave or throw UnsupportedOperationException — code iterating birds and calling fly() breaks. The smell LSP prevents is exactly this: subclasses that weaken the base contract, throw on inherited operations, return degenerate values, or require type checks (if (x instanceof Square)) at call sites.\n\nThe fix is usually to rethink the hierarchy with composition or better abstractions. For shapes, drop the inheritance and have both Square and Rectangle implement an immutable Shape interface with area(), removing the mutating setters that caused the conflict. For birds, separate capabilities: a Flyable interface implemented only by birds that actually fly, so Penguin simply does not implement it. The litmus test in interviews: "can I replace the parent with any child everywhere and have all existing tests still pass?" If not, LSP is violated and the hierarchy is wrong.',

        explanation:
          'The Interface Segregation Principle states that clients should not be forced to depend on interface methods they do not use. Big, "fat" interfaces couple unrelated clients together and force implementers to provide methods that make no sense for them. The remedy is to split a fat interface into several small, role-specific interfaces so each client depends only on what it actually needs.\n\nThe smell ISP prevents is the fat interface implemented with empty bodies or thrown exceptions. The textbook example: an interface Machine { print(); scan(); fax(); }. A modern AllInOnePrinter implements all three happily. But an OldPrinter that can only print is now forced to implement scan() and fax() too — typically by throwing UnsupportedOperationException or doing nothing. That is the same smell as an LSP violation, and it means every change to fax() forces recompilation/retesting of clients that only ever print.\n\nThe refactored good design segregates the fat interface into role interfaces: Printer { print(); }, Scanner { scan(); }, and Fax { fax(); }. The AllInOnePrinter implements all three; the OldPrinter implements only Printer. Clients now depend on the narrow interface they need — a function that only prints takes a Printer, so it is completely insulated from changes to scanning or faxing. This reduces coupling and removes the meaningless stub implementations.\n\nISP and SRP are closely related but operate at different levels: SRP is about a class having one responsibility; ISP is about an interface (a contract) being focused so its clients are not over-coupled. A good rule of thumb: if implementers of an interface routinely leave some methods empty or throwing, or if different callers use disjoint subsets of its methods, the interface is too fat and should be split. In interviews, spotting a fat interface and proposing role interfaces is a clean, high-signal answer.',

        topic: 'Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)',
        summary: 'Depend on abstractions, not concretions; high-level modules should not depend on low-level ones.',
        explanation:
          'The Dependency Inversion Principle has two parts: (1) high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules — both should depend on abstractions; and (2) abstractions should not depend on details — details should depend on abstractions. The word "inversion" refers to flipping the traditional dependency direction: instead of business logic depending directly on a concrete database/email/SMS class, both the business logic and the concrete class depend on an interface in the middle.\n\nThe smell DIP prevents is high-level policy hard-wired to a concrete low-level detail. Bad design: a NotificationService that does new EmailSender() inside itself and calls emailSender.send(...). The high-level notification policy now depends on a specific concrete EmailSender. To add SMS you must edit NotificationService, you cannot unit-test it without sending real email, and you cannot reuse it with a different transport. The dependency arrow points from the important high-level class down to a volatile detail.\n\nThe refactored good design introduces an abstraction the high-level module owns: an interface MessageSender { send(msg); }. NotificationService depends on MessageSender (injected via its constructor), and concrete EmailSender and SmsSender implement MessageSender. Now the high-level module depends only on the abstraction; the details depend on that same abstraction. You can add SmsSender without touching NotificationService (this also gives you OCP), inject a mock MessageSender in tests, and swap transports freely. The dependency has been "inverted" — the detail now points up at the abstraction.\n\nDIP is the principle behind dependency injection (DI) and inversion-of-control containers. The practical mechanics: program to interfaces, never new up volatile dependencies inside a class, and pass dependencies in through the constructor (or a setter/factory). A subtle point Uncle Bob stresses: the abstraction should be owned by the high-level module (defined in terms of what the policy needs), not by the low-level detail — otherwise you have just renamed the coupling. In interviews, DIP is the cleanest way to justify constructor injection and to make a design testable; mentioning it alongside "and this lets me inject a mock in tests" is high signal.',

        summary: 'Three pragmatic rules: don\'t repeat yourself, keep it simple, don\'t build what you don\'t need.',
        explanation:
          'DRY — Don\'t Repeat Yourself — says every piece of knowledge should have a single, authoritative representation in the system. Duplicated logic (validation copy-pasted into five places, a tax rate hard-coded in many methods) means a change must be made in every copy, and the copies inevitably drift, causing bugs. You remove duplication by extracting it into one function, class, or constant. A caveat: DRY is about duplicated knowledge, not coincidentally-identical code — two pieces that look alike today but change for different reasons should stay separate, otherwise you create false coupling.\n\nKISS — Keep It Simple, Stupid — says prefer the simplest design that solves the problem. Complexity is the enemy of maintainability: clever one-liners, deep inheritance trees, premature generalisation, and excess configuration all make code harder to read and change. The simplest solution that a teammate can understand at a glance usually wins. KISS does not mean simplistic or under-engineered; it means not adding accidental complexity beyond what the problem demands.\n\nYAGNI — You Aren\'t Gonna Need It — says do not build functionality until it is actually required. Engineers love to add "flexibility for the future" — a plugin system, a config option, a generic framework — for requirements that never materialise. That speculative code costs time to write, must be maintained and tested, and often guesses the future wrong, getting in the way when the real requirement arrives. Build for today\'s requirements; add abstraction when a second concrete case actually appears.\n\nThese three are in productive tension with each other and with SOLID. Over-applying DRY can hurt KISS (a tortured generic abstraction to avoid two lines of duplication) and YAGNI (building a framework for reuse that never happens). The senior skill is balance: remove genuine duplication, keep designs as simple as the requirements allow, and resist speculative generality. In interviews, citing YAGNI is a clean way to defend not adding a pattern that the problem doesn\'t justify yet.',

        summary: 'Depend on abstractions and assemble behaviour from parts rather than inheriting it.',
        explanation:
          'Two of the most quoted Gang-of-Four maxims are "program to an interface, not an implementation" and "favour object composition over class inheritance." Together they are the backbone of flexible OOP design and underpin most design patterns.\n\n"Program to an interface, not an implementation" means your variables, parameters, and return types should be declared as the most abstract type that suffices (an interface or abstract class), not a concrete class. Write List<Order> orders = new ArrayList<>(), not ArrayList<Order> orders = ...; declare a method to take a MessageSender, not an EmailSender. This decouples callers from concrete types so you can swap implementations (ArrayList to LinkedList, Email to SMS) without touching the client, and it enables polymorphism and testing with mocks. It is the everyday application of DIP.\n\n"Favour composition over inheritance" means build complex behaviour by assembling objects (HAS-A) rather than extending a base class (IS-A). Inheritance is static — chosen at compile time, all-or-nothing, and it leaks the parent\'s internals into the subclass (the fragile base class problem). Composition is dynamic — you hold a reference to a collaborator behind an interface and delegate to it, so you can change behaviour at runtime and only depend on the collaborator\'s public contract. The classic illustration is the combinatorial explosion of subclasses: modelling a coffee with milk, with sugar, with both, with double milk... as a subclass per combination explodes, whereas the Decorator pattern composes add-ons at runtime with a handful of classes.\n\nThe two principles reinforce each other: you compose objects that you reference through interfaces. This is exactly how Strategy (inject an algorithm via an interface), Decorator (wrap a component implementing the same interface), and Adapter work. The practical heuristic: reach for an interface-typed field and delegation by default; only use inheritance for a genuine, stable IS-A that needs substitutability. In interviews, "I\'d compose these behind an interface so I can swap and test them" is a phrase that signals maturity.',

        topic: 'Law of Demeter & Separation of Concerns',
        summary: 'Talk only to your immediate friends; keep distinct concerns in distinct modules.',
        explanation:
          'The Law of Demeter (LoD), the "principle of least knowledge," says a method should only talk to its immediate collaborators — not reach through them to distant objects. Concretely, a method m of object O may call methods on: O itself, O\'s own fields, m\'s parameters, and objects m creates. It should NOT call methods on objects returned by other calls. The classic violation is a "train wreck": order.getCustomer().getAddress().getCity().toUpperCase(). Each dot couples your code to another class\'s internal structure, so a change anywhere in that chain breaks you.\n\nThe fix is to add a method that hides the navigation: order.getCustomerCity() (which internally does the chaining once) or, better, push behaviour to where the data lives ("Tell, Don\'t Ask"): instead of pulling data out to act on it, tell the object to do the work — order.ship() rather than reading the address out and shipping it from outside. LoD reduces coupling because callers depend only on their direct neighbours\' interfaces, not on the whole object graph. The caveat: data-transfer objects, fluent builders, and stream pipelines legitimately chain calls; LoD targets behavioural coupling to foreign internals, not every dot.\n\nSeparation of Concerns (SoC) is the broader principle that a system should be decomposed into parts that each address a distinct concern, with minimal overlap. The canonical example is layering: presentation (UI), business logic (domain), and data access (persistence) live in separate layers, each ignorant of the others\' internals and communicating through defined interfaces. MVC, the layered architecture, and hexagonal/ports-and-adapters all apply SoC. The benefit is that you can change the UI without touching business rules, swap the database without changing the domain, and test each layer independently.\n\nLoD and SoC both serve low coupling and high cohesion from different angles: LoD at the method/object-interaction level (don\'t reach through neighbours), SoC at the architectural level (keep concerns in separate modules). In interviews, spotting a train-wreck chain and proposing a delegating method, or proposing a layered separation between domain and persistence, are concrete, senior-sounding moves.',

        topic: 'GRASP Patterns (Responsibility Assignment)',
        summary: 'GRASP gives principled answers to "which class should have this responsibility?"',
        explanation:
          'GRASP — General Responsibility Assignment Software Patterns — is a set of guidelines by Craig Larman for the hardest part of OOD: deciding which class should own which responsibility. While SOLID tells you what good structure looks like, GRASP tells you how to assign methods and data to classes in the first place. The core five for interviews are Information Expert, Creator, Controller, Low Coupling, and High Cohesion.\n\nInformation Expert: assign a responsibility to the class that has the information needed to fulfil it. To compute an order\'s total, the Order (which holds the line items) should do it, not some external service — the object with the data does the work. This keeps behaviour next to data, supporting encapsulation and low coupling. Creator: assign the responsibility of creating an object B to a class A that aggregates/contains B, closely uses B, or has the data to initialise B. An Order creates its LineItems because it aggregates them. This avoids spreading construction logic and keeps creation where the relationship already exists.\n\nController: assign the responsibility of handling a system input/use-case event to a coordinating class that is not the UI — a use-case controller (e.g. OrderController / PlaceOrderHandler) or a facade. This keeps UI thin and routes requests to the domain, separating presentation from logic (it is the C in MVC). Low Coupling and High Cohesion are the same goals you already met — GRASP frames them as evaluative principles you apply to every assignment: prefer the assignment that produces fewer dependencies and more focused classes.\n\nThe other GRASP patterns (Polymorphism, Pure Fabrication, Indirection, Protected Variations) extend the set: Polymorphism handles type-based variation with subtypes instead of conditionals; Pure Fabrication invents a non-domain class (like a Repository or Service) to keep cohesion when no domain class fits; Indirection introduces a mediator to decouple two classes; Protected Variations wraps unstable points behind a stable interface (the generalisation of OCP/DIP). In interviews, naming the GRASP rationale ("by Information Expert, the Cart should compute its own total") is a precise way to justify where you put a method.',

        explanation:
          'A machine-coding / LLD round is open-ended on purpose, so the biggest differentiator is having a repeatable process instead of jumping straight to code. The proven sequence is: (1) Clarify requirements and scope, (2) Identify actors and entities (nouns), (3) Define attributes and behaviours (verbs), (4) Establish relationships and multiplicities, (5) Apply SOLID and the right design patterns, (6) Draw the class diagram, (7) Write a clean code skeleton, then (8) Handle concurrency and edge cases. Doing these in order keeps you calm and shows the interviewer a structured mind.\n\nStep 1 — clarify and scope. Never assume. Ask what the system must do, who uses it, and explicitly negotiate scope: "Should I support multiple payment methods? Concurrency? Persistence, or in-memory is fine?" In a 60-90 minute round you must trim aggressively — confirm an in-memory model, a single happy path plus key edge cases, and a couple of extension points. Write the agreed requirements down so you and the interviewer share a contract.\n\nStep 2-4 — model. Pull the nouns from the requirements to find candidate classes/entities (User, Account, Transaction), and the actors (who initiates actions). Pull the verbs to find behaviours/methods (withdraw, transfer, notify). Then connect them: which class HAS-A which (composition/aggregation), which IS-A which (inheritance), and the multiplicities (a User has 1..* Accounts). This noun/verb extraction is the heart of OOD and quickly yields a first-cut model.\n\nStep 5-8 — refine and build. Identify where behaviour varies and apply patterns (Strategy for interchangeable algorithms, Factory for creation, Observer for notifications, State for lifecycle), and sanity-check against SOLID (each class one responsibility? depending on interfaces?). Draw the class diagram so the structure is visible, then translate it into a code skeleton: enums, interfaces, classes with fields and method signatures, filling in core logic first and stubbing the rest. Finally address concurrency (where is shared mutable state? do I need synchronisation or concurrent collections?) and edge cases (invalid input, empty/duplicate, capacity limits).

        explanation:
          'Let us apply the playbook to a classic warm-up: design a Coffee Machine that can serve a few recipes (Espresso, Latte, Cappuccino), tracks ingredient inventory, and dispenses a selected drink, rejecting it if ingredients are insufficient. This is small enough to finish but rich enough to show structure.\n\nStep 1, clarify/scope: in-memory, a fixed menu loaded at startup, ingredients are tracked quantities (water, milk, coffee, sugar), a drink can be made only if all its required ingredients are available, and after dispensing the inventory is decremented. Concurrency: assume a single dispensing slot but make the inventory thread-safe in case of concurrent selections. Step 2-3, nouns/verbs: nouns give us CoffeeMachine, Beverage/Recipe, Ingredient, Inventory, and a Button/selection; verbs give us selectBeverage, dispense, hasEnough, deductIngredients, refill.\n\nStep 4-5, relationships and patterns: CoffeeMachine HAS-A Inventory (composition) and HAS-A list of Recipes (each Recipe HAS-A map of Ingredient to quantity). For creating beverages we use a simple Factory (BeverageFactory creates the right Recipe by type), which keeps the machine closed for modification when a new drink is added — adding a recipe is a new entry, not edits to dispensing logic (OCP). We program to interfaces where it helps and keep responsibilities split: Inventory owns ingredient quantities and the hasEnough/deduct logic (Information Expert), Recipe owns its required ingredients, and CoffeeMachine orchestrates (Controller).\n\nStep 6-8, diagram, skeleton, concurrency/edge cases: the class diagram below captures the structure. The skeleton would define an enum BeverageType, a Recipe with Map<Ingredient,Integer> requirements, an Inventory with a thread-safe map plus synchronized hasEnough()/deduct(), a BeverageFactory, and a CoffeeMachine.dispense(type) that asks the inventory whether it has enough, deducts atomically, and returns the beverage or throws InsufficientIngredientsException. Edge cases: unknown beverage type, insufficient ingredients, concurrent dispense of the last unit (handled by synchronising the check-and-deduct as one atomic step so two threads cannot both pass the check). Narrating this — "I synchronise check-and-deduct together to avoid a race on the last unit" — is exactly the senior signal interviewers want.',

          { q: 'Walk me through designing a coffee machine.', a: 'Clarify scope (in-memory, fixed menu, decrement inventory, thread safety). Nouns give CoffeeMachine, Recipe, Ingredient, Inventory; verbs give dispense/hasEnough/deduct/refill. CoffeeMachine composes an Inventory and Recipes; a BeverageFactory creates recipes. Inventory owns stock and the check/deduct logic (Information Expert); CoffeeMachine orchestrates (Controller). dispense() atomically checks-and-deducts and throws on shortage.' },
          { q: 'Where does the inventory-check logic belong and why?', a: 'On the Inventory class, by the Information Expert principle — it owns the ingredient quantities, so it should answer hasEnough() and perform deduct(). Putting it elsewhere would mean exposing the stock map and scattering the logic, increasing coupling.' },
          { q: 'How would you make adding a new drink easy?', a: 'Drive creation through a BeverageFactory and represent a drink as a Recipe (type + required-ingredients map). Adding a drink means registering a new recipe entry, not editing the dispensing code — satisfying the Open/Closed Principle.' },
          { q: 'What concurrency issue exists and how do you handle it?', a: 'A race on the last unit of an ingredient: two threads could both pass hasEnough() and then both deduct, going negative. Handle it by making check-and-deduct a single atomic operation — synchronise that critical section (or use an atomic compare-and-update) so only one thread succeeds.' },
          { q: 'Which edge cases would you handle?', a: 'Unknown/unsupported beverage type, insufficient ingredients (throw a custom InsufficientIngredientsException), refill of an unknown ingredient, and zero/negative quantities. Each should fail fast with a clear error rather than corrupting state.' },
          { q: 'Which patterns appear in this design and why?', a: 'Factory Method to create recipes by type (decouples creation, supports OCP). If drink preparation steps varied, Template Method or Strategy could model the brew steps. The design also leans on GRASP (Information Expert, Controller) and composition over inheritance for the machine\'s parts.' },

        topic: 'Time Management in a 60-90 Minute Machine-Coding Round',
        summary: 'Budget the clock: short on design, most on core code, reserve time for edge cases & demo.',
        explanation:
          'A machine-coding round is as much a time-management test as a design test. Candidates fail not because they cannot design, but because they over-invest in one phase and run out of time with nothing runnable. The fix is a deliberate time budget that you state to yourself (and sometimes the interviewer) at the start.\n\nA solid budget for a 60-90 minute round: spend the first ~10-15% clarifying requirements and fixing scope, ~15-20% on the class design and a quick class diagram, ~45-55% writing the core working code (the happy path of the primary use cases), ~10-15% on edge cases, validation, and concurrency, and the final ~5-10% on a quick demo/driver (a main method showing it works) and cleanup. The single most important rule: get something runnable early. A compiling, demoable core beats an elegant half-written design every time.\n\nScope ruthlessly. When the problem is large (a parking lot, a splitwise, a BookMyShow), pick the 2-3 core use cases and explicitly defer the rest: "I\'ll implement booking and pricing now and leave seat-type variations and refunds as clear extension points." Tell the interviewer what you are deferring and why — that is judgement, not weakness. Build vertically (one full use case end-to-end) rather than horizontally (all entities but nothing working), so you always have a working slice.\n\nKeep code clean as you go because there is rarely time for a big refactor at the end: meaningful names, small methods, enums for fixed sets, interfaces at variation points, and a custom exception or two. Use in-memory collections rather than a real database unless asked. Leave the last few minutes to run your driver, fix the obvious bug it reveals, and verbally list what you would add with more time (persistence, more edge cases, more tests). Communicating that roadmap shows maturity even when the code is incomplete. In short: clarify fast, design briefly, code the core early, harden edges, and always leave time to demonstrate it runs.',
